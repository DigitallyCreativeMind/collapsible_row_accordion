Hello everyone,

I am Abiola Smith. I have over five years of experience in 
Software development. After all these years, I have decided 
to share everything I know in Shopify.

What is Shopify?

Shopify is a complete commerce platform that allows you to start, grow and maanage your business . Shopify is completely cloud-based and hosted, which means you do not have to worry about upgrading or maintaining the software or servers. This allows you to focus on the actual business, and be able to access your store from anywhere with an internet connection.

Today, I will be setting up Shopify theme on a local system; TTo do this, I need t first of al install Themekit.

What is Themekit?

Themekit is a command line tool that allows you to interact between your Shopify store and a local system.

Why Themkit?
- It allows interaction between Shopify and local system
- It allows you to uload or downoad theme files
- It allows you to make changes locally and update it automatically
- It is available on MacOs, Linus and Windows.

How can we use Themekit?

We can use Themekit by first installing it. To do this, we can either download the reqired ackage and install it or install it directly using the Terminal. The required ackage are Brew for MacOs and Chocolatey for Windows.
